5 steps
==> define/part sub problem
==> guess (part of solution)
==> relate subproblem solution
==> recurse & memoize OR DP table bottom up
==> solve original problem

Memoization => stores the already calculated  results.
butwe need to be careful if subpromlem has a recursive depency on each other it would become infinte
