Algorithm
==> critera to choose a algo should be rate of growth of input data.
    ==> time complexity
    There are 3 criterias to denote the complexity
    BigO O() => It suggests to take the upper bound of the complexity, i.e. BigO is most widely used to tell the complexity. (Worst case scenario)
    Omega ==> Lower bound. i.e. Best case scenario
    theta ==> Middle bound. i.e. average case

possible complexity ==>
1 < logn < sqrt(n) < n < n*n < n*n*n
        ==> linear complexity
    ==> space complexity
